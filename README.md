# Android Google Maps API v2 Add-ons
A collection of add-ons for use with the Android Google Maps API v2 framework.

## Requirements
* Android SDK 8 or Higher
* Google Play Services Library

## Installation
1. Ensure your Android application project is set up to use the Google Maps API v2. Follow [these](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#installing_the_google_maps_android_v2_api) instructions if you need help.
2. Download or `git clone` this library into your application project.
3. Import the library into your Eclipse workspace.
4. Add the newly imported Android Library Project as a dependency to your application project.

## Sample Usage

If you have an MBTiles offline layer you would like to use, the following code should work.

```` java
// Retrieve GoogleMap instance from MapFragment or elsewhere
GoogleMap map;

// Create new TileOverlayOptions instance.
TileOverlayOptions opts = new TileOverlayOptions();

// Get a File reference to the MBTiles file.
File myMBTiles;

// Create an instance of MapBoxOfflineTileProvider.
MapBoxOfflineTileProvider provider = new MapBoxOfflineTileProvider(myMBTiles);

// Set the tile provider on the TileOverlayOptions.
opts.tileProvider(provider);

// Add the tile overlay to the map.
TileOverlay overlay = map.addTileOverlay(opts);

// Sometime later when the map view is destroyed, close the provider.
// This is important to prevent a leak of the backing SQLiteDatabase.
provider.close();
````

## Maki

Maki is MapBox's overlay icons API. The class MakiFactory displays Maki icons on a map just by specifying the icon name and its lat/lon.

```` java
new MakiFactory(map).drawMaki("campsite", lat, lon);
````

A full list of icon names can be found [here](http://www.mapbox.com/maki/).
